A twist on classic pong, compete against yourself to keep the ball in the air. The first game I ever programmed end of senior 
year of high school in 2019. I watched the linked video to understamd how games are programmed. I then used the basic 
functions to build my own game where the user has to keep the ball from touching the ground as long as possible.
